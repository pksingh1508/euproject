    shortDesc:
      "The UK Home Office has announced a significant overhaul of its points-based immigration system, set to take effect in January 2026. The new rules introduce a higher minimum salary requirement for most Skilled Worker visa applicants, aiming to attract high-earners and reduce net migration. The changes also include a revised Shortage Occupation List, with several roles being removed and new ones added in the green energy and AI sectors. Immigration experts suggest that these adjustments will make it more challenging for businesses to recruit overseas talent for mid-level positions, potentially leading to labor shortages.",
